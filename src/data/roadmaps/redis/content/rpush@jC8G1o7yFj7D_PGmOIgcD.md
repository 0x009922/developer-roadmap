# RPUSH

`RPUSH` is a Redis command that adds one or more elements to the end of a list. If the list does not exist, it is created before the elements are added. The command returns the length of the list after the operation, making it useful for tracking the size of the list. `RPUSH` is commonly used for implementing data structures like queues and stacks, where new elements need to be appended for subsequent processing. Its atomic nature ensures that the operation is safe in concurrent environments, allowing multiple clients to add elements to the list without conflicts.
