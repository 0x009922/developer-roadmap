# redis-benchmark

`redis-benchmark` is a utility provided with Redis that measures the performance of the Redis server by simulating various types of workloads. It allows users to test the speed and responsiveness of Redis commands under different conditions, providing metrics such as requests per second and latency. The tool can simulate multiple clients and different command types, such as `GET`, `SET`, and `INCR`, enabling users to evaluate the performance of their Redis configuration and hardware. By adjusting parameters like the number of parallel connections and the number of requests to be sent, `redis-benchmark` helps identify performance bottlenecks, optimize configurations, and assess the impact of changes to the Redis environment, making it a valuable tool for capacity planning and performance tuning.
