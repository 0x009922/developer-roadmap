# In-memory Data Structure Store

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that offers high-speed data access by keeping the entire dataset in RAM, enabling extremely low latency for read and write operations. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and more, making it versatile for use cases like caching, session management, real-time analytics, and messaging. Being in-memory, Redis achieves superior performance compared to disk-based databases, but it can be configured to persist data to disk using RDB or AOF, ensuring durability and reliability alongside its high throughput.
