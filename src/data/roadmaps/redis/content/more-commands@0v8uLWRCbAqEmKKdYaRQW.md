# More Commands - Strings

Redis strings include a variety of operations that go beyond basic SET and GET functionality. Examples include MSET and MGET for setting and getting multiple keys at once, GETSET to set a new value while returning the old one, and SETEX or PSETEX for setting a value with an expiration time. Other commands like INCRBY and DECRBY allow incrementing or decrementing by a specified amount, while BITCOUNT and BITOP provide bit-level manipulations. These additional commands expand the versatility of strings, enabling complex operations like counters, multi-key interactions, and efficient bitwise processing, making Redis strings highly flexible for varied use cases.
