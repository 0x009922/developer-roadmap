# Search

Redis Search enhances the Redis experience by offering a robust set of search and query features, including a rich query language, incremental indexing for JSON and hash documents, vector search, full-text search, geospatial queries, and aggregations. These capabilities allow Redis to function as a document database, vector database, secondary index, and search engine, making it suitable for a variety of applications. To get started, users can follow a quick start guide, learn how to create an index, and utilize Redis Insight alongside Redis Copilot for executing complex queries using simple, plain language prompts. Itâ€™s important to note that Redis Search is not included by default in the basic Redis server; it must be installed through Redis Stack or Redis Enterprise, both of which provide Redis Search and other valuable modules.
