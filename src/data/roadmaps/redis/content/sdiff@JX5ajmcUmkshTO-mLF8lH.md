# SDIFF

`SDIFF` is a Redis command used to compute the difference between one or more sets, returning a new set containing elements that are present in the first set but not in any of the subsequent sets. This operation helps identify unique members of a set in relation to others, which can be useful in various applications, such as analyzing user preferences, filtering out common elements, or performing set operations in mathematical contexts. If any of the specified sets do not exist, they are treated as empty sets, and the command returns the members of the first set. The command operates efficiently, making it suitable for scenarios involving large datasets while maintaining low latency.
