# More Commands - Geospatial Indexes

Redis Geospatial indexes include operations like GEODIST to calculate the distance between two members of a geospatial set, GEOHASH to retrieve the Geohash representation of locations, and GEOPOS to get the longitude and latitude of specified members. Additionally, GEORADIUS and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER allow searching for members within a given radius based on coordinates or a reference member. These commands enable efficient handling of location-based data, supporting use cases like proximity searches, real-time tracking, and geolocation-based recommendations, making Redis Geospatial indexes a powerful tool for spatial data management.
