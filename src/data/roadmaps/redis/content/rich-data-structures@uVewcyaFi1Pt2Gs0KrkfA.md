# Rich Data Structures

Redis offers a variety of rich data structures that extend beyond simple key-value pairs, enabling developers to model complex data types and relationships efficiently. These include:

1. **Strings**: Basic key-value pairs that can hold text, numbers, or binary data, supporting various operations like incrementing and appending.
  
2. **Hashes**: Collections of key-value pairs stored within a single key, ideal for representing objects and allowing for efficient field access and modification.

3. **Lists**: Ordered collections of strings that support push and pop operations from both ends, making them suitable for implementing queues and stacks.

4. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique strings, providing efficient membership tests, and operations like unions and intersections.

5. **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but with an associated score for each element, enabling ordered retrieval based on scores, making them perfect for leaderboards.

6. **Streams**: Log data structures that allow for storing and processing streams of messages, supporting features like consumer groups for parallel processing.

7. **Geospatial Indexes**: Structures that enable the storage and querying of geographic data, facilitating location-based applications.

These rich data structures allow Redis to cater to a wide range of use cases, from caching and session management to real-time analytics and messaging, all while maintaining high performance and low latency.
