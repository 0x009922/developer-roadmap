# More Commands - Sorted Sets

Redis Sorted Sets include operations like ZREVRANGE to get elements in reverse order, ZRANGEBYLEX to retrieve elements within a specific lexicographical range, and ZINTERSTORE or ZUNIONSTORE to perform intersection and union operations on multiple sorted sets and store the results. Commands like ZREMrangeBYRANK and ZREMRANGEBYSCORE allow for removing elements based on their rank or score ranges. These additional commands make Sorted Sets powerful for scenarios like leaderboards, priority queues, and ranking systems, offering fine-grained control over ordered data and enabling complex scoring and ranking use cases.
